You literally have to kill the baby to stop it from becoming a fully-formed version of itself - that is literally it. You have to kill it to stop it from getting to a point that you 'begin to feel bad'. It is ridiculous.The fact that, when unimpeded, that baby will grow into an adult individual should be a pretty obvious reminder to people of what they're actually doing.I've been saying this for a little while, but I'm sure a time will come when society collectively looks back on this period and shudders at the horror of it all. \n",

The notion that discontent with the situation justifies killing a human doesn't stack up.The point about the broken USA healthcare system will never justify the killing of unborn children. It also serves as a first-world excuse that is essentially based around inconvenience.Finally, the argument that \"others do horrible things so therefore why can't we do this horrible thing too\" doesn't make any kind of sense either. \n",
